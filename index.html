              <p>The new Apple Watch can therefore cost up to 7 thousand dollars, a staggering figure which, however, has already been surpassed by a special edition of Apple's wearable device thanks to the US company Brikk which has launched a line of luxury Apple Watches. Three different luxury models made with shells in 24-karat yellow gold, 18-karat rose gold and 950 platinum. The luxury models of the smart watch differ according to the number and value of the diamonds that will be set on the body and on the strap. The standard luxury model made by Brikk is priced at $7,495, $11,995 for the Deluxe version, and $69,995 for the Omni model. It is then possible to make some changes and customizations that can bring the cost of the device up to 75 thousand dollars</p>

              <h2 class="fw-normal">3. APPLE IPHONE 14 PRO AND PRO MAX</h2>
              <p>The ever-larger lens array may not be the only bumpy thing about the iPhone 14 Pro Max's camera. Some users are reporting that the phone is making grinding noises and vibrating when they try to take photos with third-party apps like SnapChat and TikTok, severely distorting the camera images and, in some cases, damaging the camera's hardware. The issue doesn't appear to be universal, but MacRumors has gathered complaints from users across multiple social media sites and its own forums, as has The Guardian. Some YouTubers have also documented the phenomenon.Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says that Apple has acknowledged the issue and plans to release a fix next week.The distortion and vibration is most likely being caused by the camera's optical image stabilization gyroscope, which when working normally corrects for shaking and hand motion so that the camera can take in a bit more light without taking blurry images (although the iPhone cameras do feature a kind of "optical" zoom, it's achieved using different physical lenses and not one lens with mechanical parts that can physically zoom in and out).Until Apple releases a fix, users should try to refrain from using the camera within these apps—allowing the OIS gyroscope to grind for extended periods of time could damage the camera, and Apple specifically warns against attaching iPhones to motorcycles or other things that vibrate excessively. When possible, shooting photos or videos with the built-in camera app and then uploading or importing them to your third-party app of choice is a workaround that could save your device some stress.
              If you do experience hardware damage as a result of this bug, you should be able to get your phone repaired or replaced under warranty.</p>
